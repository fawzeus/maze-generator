# Maze Generation Algorithms

This project showcases various maze generation algorithms implemented in C++ using SFML.four algorithms are implemented: Depth-First Search (DFS), Hunt and Kill, Prim's Maze, and the Shift Origin algorithm. Each algorithm is visually demonstrated, including how Shift Origin creates dynamically evolving mazes.

## Features

- Visualization of DFS, Hunt and Kill, Prim's Maze, and Shift Origin algorithms.
- Real-time graphics and interaction using SFML.
- Dynamic maze generation with the Shift Origin algorithm.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- C++ Compiler
- SFML Library

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fawzeus/maze-generator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```sh
