# Maze Generation Algorithms

This project showcases various maze generation algorithms implemented in C++ using SFML. Four algorithms are implemented: Depth-First Search (DFS), Hunt and Kill, Prim's Maze, and the Shift Origin algorithm. Each algorithm is visually demonstrated, including how Shift Origin creates dynamically evolving mazes.

## Features

- Visualization of DFS, Hunt and Kill, Prim's Maze, and Shift Origin algorithms.
- Real-time graphics and interaction using SFML.
- Dynamic maze generation with the Shift Origin algorithm.
